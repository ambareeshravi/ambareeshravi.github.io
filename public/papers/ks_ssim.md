### Abstract
<p class="message">
The task of anomaly detection has exceptional potential with a spectrum of applications and the current reconstruction based methods of anomaly detection in images using convolutional AutoEncoders have significant room for improvement to achieve better performance at the same computational cost. Moreover, the conventional objective functions like mean squared error to train the models, ignore the visual components that are required to reconstruct data as close to the inputs thereby leading to poor reconstructions. These factors warrant
the need for a better architecture that is capable of efficient learning and better reconstructions of only normal images in order to improve anomaly detection performance. To overcome the limitations of existing models, we introduce a novel, model agnostic framework to readily improve unsupervised anomaly detection using a modified Convolutional AutoEncoder architecture to strengthen kernel-level learning with an optimized, visual similarity based loss function to score image anomalies, without any increment in data requirement or computational cost. We present experimental evidence to illustrate the potential of the
proposed novel approach on two data sets from different domains and of different complexity.
