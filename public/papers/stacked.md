### Abstract
<p class="message">
This short paper aims to discuss the effectiveness and performance of classical machine learning approaches for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). It proposes two important models - Extra Trees and Stacked Classifier with the emphasize on the best practices, heuristics and measures that are required to maximize the performance of those models.
