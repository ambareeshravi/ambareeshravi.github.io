### Abstract
<p class="message">
Learning discriminative features to detect anomalies in images is still an open problem in computer vision. Most deep learning-based methods for anomaly detection in images are compression-reconstruction based or generation based models which are not originally designed for the task of anomaly detection. Only a few methods involve dedicated objective function to help detect anomalies and they are not visually explainable as well as reconstruction based approaches. Though the popular reconstruction-based approach
for anomaly detection using Convolutional AutoEncoders has achieved the state of the art results, there is no provision to induce the fabrication of discriminatively learnt embeddings
from the inputs to well reflect anomalies in the output. In this work, we propose an approach using Support Vector Data Description as a regularizer to enforce discriminative ability to easily segregate anomalies from normality with little effort in modelling and tuning the AutoEncoders. We evaluate our approach on several visual anomaly detection datasets to show the capability of our approach. We also perform extensive ablation studies for efficient tuning of parameters.
