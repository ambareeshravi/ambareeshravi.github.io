### Abstract
We propose a novel, efficient, modular and scalable framework for content based visual media retrieval systems by leveraging the power of Deep Learning which is flexible to work both for images and videos conjointly and we also introduce an efficient comparison and filtering metric for retrieval. We put forward our findings from critical performance tests comparing our method to the predominant conventional approach to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed solution with best practices, possible improvements that may further augment the ability of retrieval architectures.
